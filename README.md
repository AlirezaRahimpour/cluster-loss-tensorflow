# cluster-loss-tensorflow
This repository is an implementation of Deep Metric Learning via Facility Location on tensorflow. We build this on Cifar100 and Densenet-40. This paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01213.pdf). For the loss layer implementation, look at [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/losses/python/metric_learning). For the Densenet implementation, look at [here](https://github.com/ikhlestov/vision_networks).

## Installation
1. Install prerequsites for `tensorflow` (see: [tensorflow-gpu installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)).
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` get required support.

## Training Procedure
1. Moify `metric_learning_densenet.py` for training-params and densenet-params. We pick Cifar100 as our training data, because it's tiny, save GPU-memory (when batch size 64, it cost about 4.6G GPU-Memory) and good for doing research.
2. Run `python metric_learning_densenet.py`, the `data_provider` with automaticlly handle data download and process. After that, start Densenet-Cluster-loss training.
3. Download Downsampled Imagenet with size 32x32 from [here](https://patrykchrabaszcz.github.io/Imagenet32/). Modify `metric_learning_densenet.py` train on Imagenet.

## Feature Extraction after Training
1. Modify `metric_learning_densenet.py` extract feature embeddings on cifar test set, the embeddings is saved with `.npy` format used for evaluation process.

## Clustering and Retrieval Evaluation
1. Run `python visualization/tsne.py` can plot and save the cluster result on Cifar database.
